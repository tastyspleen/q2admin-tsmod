; Display when impulses are generated / used 
; This is a future-proof thing that will display messages when impulses are used.  The reason is if
; the zbot person has a zbot hack to get around the "normal" detect this will display when he is 
; sending commands.  Sort of like a back-up method of detecting zbot users.  The only problem is that
; normal clients can generate impulses as well and I don't know if this is for commanding the zbot
; or something that a normal q2 mod uses.  Only 1 q2 mod that I know off uses impulses tho so chances 
; are that it's a abot user.

;    OverDrive to get the Razor Boomslang mouse to work, popular for Mac gamers 
;    but not a supported Mac product, then they won't be able to bind to ALT24 at 
;    all meaning they are screwed or they have to bind a keyboard key to get it
